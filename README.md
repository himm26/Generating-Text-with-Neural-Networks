# Generating Text with Neural Networks
Neural networks for text generation.
This means that in addition to being used for predictive models, RNN can learn the sequences of a problems and then generate entirely plausible sequences for the problem domain.

Here we will be doing:
- Training model on a series of sentences and will predict the new sentences
- We can also use this model to predict the next word

# Dataset
[Lewis Carrollâ€™s Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11.txt)

# Data Modeling
- Extracting distinct characters from the dataset
- Mapping each character to unique interger to processing

# Models
- Convolutional Neural Network
- RNN Neural Network
- LSTM Neural Network 

Used LSTM Neuarl Network for final prediction.

# Accuracy 
67.3%
